## Description
Local harvest is a platform that connects local farmers and consumers. Our primary goal is to facilitate the purchase of fresh, locally-grown produce, promoting healthier and sustainable food choices. Additionally, our platform provides consumers with the opportunity to contribute further by making donations to support local farmers.<br>
This project is the final project from Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota.
